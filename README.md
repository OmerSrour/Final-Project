# Final-Project
CSIT 211 Final Group project

//Project Scope: 
    // - 4 total windows:
    //  	- the Main, "Decision" window that welcomes the user and
    //		  asks them to choose which team they would like to view: Defense, Offense, or Special Teams
    //		- the window for the defense, which only shows up if the button for "Defense" is chosen
    //		  in the main window
    //  	- the window for the offense... (same as #2)
    //		- the window for the special teams... (same as #2)
    //
    //************************************************************************************************************************************
    // 1) The first (main) window welcomes the user, displays the title of the program and prompts them to
    //    choose 1 of 3 buttons based on which team (defense, offense, special teams) they would like to
    //    view the players of.
    //
    // 2) After the user chooses which of the 3 teams he would like to see, the second window pops up
    //	  and the user is able to select players from that team (one selected at a time) from a combobox. 
    //
    // 3) When the user chooses a player from the combobox, they then have to click on a button 
    //	  confirming their selection.
    //
    // 4) Once the selection has been confirmed, the player's photo and all of the information for them
    //	  is displayed at the bottom of the same (team) window.
    //
    // 5) the user can choose another player and click the confirm button again to see that player's
    //	  info without having to exit out of and rerun the program (not sure how to do this)
    //
    // 6) There is a second button on the team window, that allows the user to return to the original
    // 	  window and select a different team, which causes the corresponding (second) team window to
    //	  pop up (not sure how to do this)
